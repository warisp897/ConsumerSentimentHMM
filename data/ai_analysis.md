Here is a summary of the economic regime model's outputs:

### Key Signals
*   The model robustly identifies the Low Sentiment regime with 100% probability.
*   This regime has persisted for an extended 68 months, and the overall data pattern is somewhat anomalous, nearly 1.7 standard deviations from its typical behavior for this regime.
*   Notably, Real GDP Growth is unusually strong, standing over 1.6 standard deviations above its historical baseline for a Low Sentiment period.
*   PCE Inflation is also markedly elevated, nearly 2 standard deviations above its baseline for a Low Sentiment regime, aligning with inflationary pressures but at an unusual magnitude.
*   Fiscal deficits are significantly wider than typical for this regime, over 1.6 standard deviations below their historical baseline.
*   The coexistence of strong growth with persistently low sentiment and unusually high inflation suggests mounting internal tension within the current economic state.

### Plain-Language Summary
The model currently classifies the economy in a Low Sentiment regime, influenced by the low Consumer Sentiment Index of 51, which is historically associated with concerns like inflation or uncertainty. However, the data presents a notable divergence: Real GDP Growth is unusually strong and PCE Inflation is significantly elevated, both performing well above what is typically observed during a Low Sentiment period. This creates an internal tension where robust economic activity persists alongside a long-standing environment of weak consumer sentiment, with the overall conditions being somewhat anomalous for this regime.
