*   The model expresses complete confidence in the Low Sentiment regime, with a 100% probability assigned.
*   Despite this strong conviction, the current data exhibits an anomaly score approaching 1.7 standard deviations from the Low Sentiment baseline, indicating the present situation is unusual for this specific regime.
*   Real GDP Growth and PCE Inflation are notably elevated, both approximately 1.6-1.8 standard deviations above their historical averages for a Low Sentiment environment.
*   Concurrently, the fiscal balance shows a significant deficit, roughly 1.6 standard deviations below its typical level for this regime.
*   The confluence of persistent Low Sentiment alongside strong growth and inflation metrics suggests mounting internal tension within the current economic configuration.

The model firmly places the economy in a Low Sentiment regime, primarily driven by the currently low Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) of 51. This state has persisted for 68 months and is typically linked to inflation pressure, uncertainty, or recession risk. However, the current economic data presents significant contradictions within this regime: Real GDP growth and PCE inflation are both considerably higher than what is historically typical for a Low Sentiment period, and the fiscal deficit is also larger than usual. While these factors are unusually strong for this regime, the persistently low CSI appears to be anchoring the model, preventing a shift to a High Sentiment state. This configuration, where sentiment remains low despite robust economic activity and elevated inflation, results in a statistically unusual version of the Low Sentiment regime, indicating mounting internal tension rather than a typical period of weak sentiment.
