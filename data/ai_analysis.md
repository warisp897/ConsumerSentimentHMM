The proprietary model indicates a deeply entrenched Low Sentiment regime, having persisted for 68 months, yet this pessimistic outlook exists amidst significant tension in the underlying economic drivers. Specifically, Real GDP growth is remarkably strong, significantly exceeding what is typically observed in a Low Sentiment environment, creating a clear disconnect. This suggests that consumer sentiment is being profoundly dampened not by a lack of economic activity, but rather by the persistently high PCE inflation, which is also well above its expected baseline for this regime, effectively cancelling out the positive impact of growth on consumer psyche. The larger-than-expected fiscal deficit likely acts as a tailwind, contributing to both the surprising growth and the stubborn inflationary pressures. The elevated anomaly score of 1.69 critically highlights that this combination of robust growth and high inflation is highly unusual for a prolonged Low Sentiment regime, suggesting inherent instability and a potential pivot point as these contradictory forces contend.
