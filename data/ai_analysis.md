*   The model confidently assigns the U.S. economy to a Low Sentiment regime with 100% probability.
*   This Low Sentiment regime has persisted for an extended 68 months and is presenting as somewhat unusual for its historical pattern, indicated by an average anomaly score of 1.69.
*   Real GDP Growth and PCE Inflation are notably strong, registering approximately 1.6 to 1.8 standard deviations above what is typical for a Low Sentiment period.
*   The fiscal position is also significantly weaker, with the surplus/deficit approximately 1.6 standard deviations below its baseline for this regime.
*   The robust growth and elevated inflation, occurring within a persistently classified Low Sentiment regime, indicate significant internal tension rather than historical stability.

The model currently classifies the U.S. economy as being in a 'Low Sentiment' regime with complete certainty, a state typically associated with inflation pressure, uncertainty, or recession risk. This classification has been consistently in place for an extended 68 months. However, the data reveals notable contradictions within this regime: Real GDP Growth and PCE Inflation are both significantly strong, performing well above their typical historical baselines for a period of low sentiment. This unusual combination of robust economic activity and elevated inflation alongside persistent low sentiment suggests mounting internal tension within the current economic landscape.
