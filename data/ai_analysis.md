The economy is unequivocally mired in a "Low Sentiment" regime, a deeply entrenched state confirmed with 100% certainty and stretching for an extraordinary 68 consecutive months. This prolonged period of pervasive pessimism points to fundamental and persistent underlying challenges in the economic landscape. While the overall sentiment is already low, the current raw sentiment score of 51 is particularly concerning, registering an anomaly of 1.69 standard deviations from the regime's established baseline. This significant deviation indicates that current conditions are unusually adverse, even within this extended period of negativity, suggesting sentiment is acutely pressured beyond its already subdued norm. This profound and enduring lack of confidence likely stems from a confluence of persistent inflationary pressures continuing to erode real incomes, heightened fears of stagnant GDP growth or even recessionary conditions, and the ongoing impact of tighter monetary policy on credit and investment.
