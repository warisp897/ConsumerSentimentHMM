*   The model maintains 100% confidence in the Low Sentiment regime, which has persisted for an extended 69-month duration.
*   The current month's overall economic observations are moderately anomalous for a typical Low Sentiment regime, showing an average deviation of approximately 1.7 standard deviations.
*   Key economic drivers, including Real GDP growth and PCE inflation, are notably stronger than their historical baselines conditional on a Low Sentiment regime, registering around 1.6 to 1.8 standard deviations above expected values.
*   The fiscal balance also deviates significantly, indicating a larger deficit than typically observed during periods of Low Sentiment (approximately 1.6 standard deviations below baseline).
*   These significant and unusual deviations across multiple economic indicators, combined with the elevated anomaly score, suggest mounting internal tension within the current Low Sentiment classification, rather than a stable or historically typical expression of the regime.

The model currently classifies the economic environment as a "Low Sentiment" regime with full certainty, anchored by the observed U.S. Consumer Sentiment Index of 52.9. This classification holds even though key economic indicators like Real GDP growth and PCE inflation are notably stronger than what is historically typical for a Low Sentiment period, showing deviations around 1.6 to 1.8 standard deviations above their regime-specific baselines. The fiscal balance also presents a larger deficit than is common for this regime. While these drivers suggest an unusually strong underlying economy for a Low Sentiment period—a situation registering as moderately anomalous this month—the model's high confidence reflects that the Consumer Sentiment Index itself remains firmly within the parameters of a Low Sentiment state, preventing a regime shift.
