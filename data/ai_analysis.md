The US consumer sentiment remains entrenched in a protracted Low Sentiment regime, spanning 68 months with a significant anomaly. Despite GDP growth being notably above its baseline, this strength is directly counteracted by stubbornly high inflation, which is also significantly above its baseline, eroding real purchasing power. Compounded by a tightening fiscal stance (deficit below baseline), inflation continues to serve as the structural impediment, leaving the low sentiment regime fragile regardless of headline economic activity.
